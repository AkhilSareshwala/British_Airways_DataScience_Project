British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage - April 2025

 * Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component
   of British Airways' success.
 * Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings.
 * Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying
   behaviour.---------------------------------------------“Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in the British Airways job simulation on the Forage
platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to
participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.
I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built a predictive
model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practised my data
analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoint and
communication skills by presenting insights in a real-world context.
Doing this programme confirmed that I really enjoy working with data to provide
business insights, and I'm excited to apply these skills to a Data Science team
at a company like British Airways.
